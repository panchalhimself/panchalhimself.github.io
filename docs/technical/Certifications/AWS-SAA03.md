**Observations**
* almost all questions were scenario based.
* read questions very carefully.
* exam covers the most basic and important topics.


**How I prepared ?**
* Watched conceptual videos from Acloudguru.
* Gave one mock of acloudguru and solved the paper 3 hrs before.


**Is it worth it ?**

* Exam was kind of cool as a test taker you had to provide proper solutions to the issues presented. 
* For understanding real life scenarios and providing solutions, it seems to be worth it.
