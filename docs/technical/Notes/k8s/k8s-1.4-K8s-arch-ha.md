## Kuberentes Architecture High Availability
14 June 2023

***What HA are we talkin about ?***
---

We are talking about cluster HA rather than the use case of k8s.

Components with multiple instances like multiple control plane nodes and components.

loadbalancer that balances multiple kube-api-server, etcd and other components.

kubelet needs to know loadbalancer in this case.



***Types of design pattern:-***
---

1. Stacked Configuration (etcd)
* etc runs on the same nodes as control plane nodes.

2. External Configuration (etcd)
    * etcd runs on the different nodes instead of control plane nodes.
    * Can have any no of control plane instances and external etcd nodes.
