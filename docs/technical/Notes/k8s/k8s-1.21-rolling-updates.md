# Rolling updates in kubernetes
21 June 2023

Managed using deployments.


**Rolling update**: allows deployment to use new updates without downtime via gradual replacement of old pods with new updated ones.

Change can be anything in the pod template that is part of the deployment manifest.




**Rollback**: If there is a problem in the rolling update, we can go back to previous deployment revision.



**Example** :

nginx-deployment.yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```


rollouts can be done via ```kubectl edit deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME```

or using ```kubectl apply -f DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml``` after edits.

you can check the status of the deployment rollout using 

```kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/DEPLOYMENT_NAME```

before applying things we need to make sure that we use ```--record``` flag for keeping track of the change cause. 

Example for **nginx-deployment.yaml** and **nginx-deployment** :

```kubectl apply --filename=nginx-deployment.yaml --record=true```

```kubectl edit deployment nginx-deployment --record=true```
