# DNS in kubernetes
21 June 2023


k8s internal virtual network uses dns to allow pods and services to communicate via domains instead of ips.


dns runs as a service in the cluster as a pod.


```pod-ip-address.namespace-name.pod.cluster.local```

**pod-ip-address** is ip separated by **-** instead of **.**


example:

Pod with ```192.169.10-100``` ip in default namespace will have dns as 

```192-168-10-100.default.pod.cluster.local```



--- 

**DNS of services**
---

```service-name.namespace-name.svc.cluster-domain.example```

default cluster domain is ```cluster.local```


a serice FQDN can be used to reach service from any namespace in the cluster.


To access a service in the same namespace only service name can be used.
