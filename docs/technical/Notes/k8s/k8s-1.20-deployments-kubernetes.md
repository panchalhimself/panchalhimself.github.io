deployment defines a desired state for a replica set.

deployment controller ensures the desired state by creating, deleting and replacing pods with new configs.



**replicas**

Specifies no of pod replicas in the cluster

defined under deployment spec

**selector**

defined under deployment spec

**template**

***Why use deployments ?***

Easy to scale up and down by changing the number of replicas.

For rolling updates of new version of app.

Roll back to previous version of app

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```

scaling a deployment is straightforward 

```kubectl scale deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --replicas=NO_OF_REPLICAS```


Pods can also be autoscaled

```kubectl autoscale deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --min=10 --max=15 --cpu-percent=80```
