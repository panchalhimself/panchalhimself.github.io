***Following are the phases involved during this version upgrade :-***

1. upgrade the control node.
2. upgrade the worker nodes.


We will setup the 4 node k8s cluster locally you can checkout **k8s-1.3-initialize-and-setup-k8s-cluster.md** post on how to set it up.


***steps to upgrade control node:-***

1. drain the control node using 

    ```kubectl drain CONTROL_NODE --skip-daemonsets```
