# Taints and Tolerations in kubernetes


**Taints**
---

Similar to labels but pods understand to avoid tainted nodes by default unless the pods have toleration towards it. 

Kind of like a repellent by default, unless there is some explicit toleration towards it.


**Tolerations**
---

The tolerations defined on pods make the pods tolerant to be scheduled on the specified tainted node.

Note: tolerations do not make a pod exclusive to the tainted node, infact it simply means that the pod with toleration towards a taint can be scheduled on the tainted node as well as the other normal nodes.


***Example of a simple taint***
---

**The Setup**

* A 4 node cluster 
* 1 Control Plane
* 3 Worker Nodes

**We will taint 2 worker nodes out the the 3**

Let us taint the 2 worker nodes using ```kubectl taint node db2 name=yash:NoSchedule``` and ```kubectl taint node db3 name=yash:NoSchedule```

Once we tainted the nodes let us run 5 pods of nginx and see the result.

As you can see all the 5 nginx pods are scheduled and running on the db4 node. This db4 node was the only node that was not tainted.

Let us see how our assinged taint looks like on db2 node.

**Wait we did not taint the control plane node, then why are pods not being scheduled over there ?**

Well by default kubernetes taints the control plane node with a default taint.

Let us see how it looks..
