# Backup and Restore k8s cluster data using etcd
16 June 2023


**etcd** is one of the core k8s components that stores cluster data.


***So what are we going to do ?***
---

1. We will manually backup the etcd cluster data to a file.

2. Delete the etcd data dir and make it corrupt. 

3. Restore the etcd cluster data from the backedup file.



We will utilze **etcdctl** utility to perform the backup and restore.

---

We will setup the 3 node k8s cluster from the k8s-1.4 notes.

**Fetch the cluster name : -**

```
ETCDCTL_API=3 \
etcdctl get cluster.name \
--endpoints=https://IP_CONTROL_NODE:2379 \
--cacert=/PATH/TO/THE/etcd-ca.pem \
--cert=/PATH/TO/THE/etcd-server.crt \
--key=/PATH/TO/THE/etcd-server.key
```

**Backup the cluster data : -**

```
ETCDCTL_API=3 \
etcdctl snapshot save /PATH/TO/SAVE/BACKUPS \
--endpoints=https://IP_CONTROL_NODE:2379 \
--cacert=/PATH/TO/THE/etcd-ca.pem \
--cert=/PATH/TO/THE/etcd-server.crt \
--key=/PATH/TO/THE/etcd-server.key
```


Note: the above steps are executed from the etcd installation
