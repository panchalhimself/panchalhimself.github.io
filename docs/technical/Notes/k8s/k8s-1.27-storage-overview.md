# Storage overview in kubernetes
24 June 2023

**Container Storage**
---

The default container file system is shortlived.

The contents will exist as long as the container exists.


**Volumes**
---

For persistant data.

Store data outside the container file system.



**Persistent Volume**
---

Store the persistent data as an abstract resource and consumed by the pods.

Container > Persistent Volume Claim > Persistent Volume > External Storage

You need a PVC associated with the container to use the volume.


**Volume Types**
---

Volume types determine handling of the storage.

NFS

Cloud 

ConfigMaps and Secrets

Directory on the K8s node.


---

**Using K8s Volumes**
---

**Volumes and volumeMounts**

So we need a volumes under the spec as well as a volumeMounts unde the container block for the deined container.

**example.yaml**
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.k8s.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /data
```

**Sharing Volumes between Containers.**

needs to be tested.....

**shared-example.yaml**
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.k8s.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container-input
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /input
      name: test-volume
  - image: registry.k8s.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container-output
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /output
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /data
```



**Common Volume Types**


**hostPath** 

**emptyDir** 

**hostPath**

**Persistent Volumes**
