# Network policies in kubernetes
21 June 2023

allows flow control to and from pods.

isolates pods from traffic they do not require.


pods are non isolated and open to all communication by default.

Any network policy that selects pod will cause it to be isolated and abide the network policy rules.


**podSelector**

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: networkpolicy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      labelkey: labelkeyvalue
```


A networkPolicy can have ingress, egress or both.


ingress: incomming traffic to the pod.
egress: traffic leaving the pods.

**from selector:** selects ingress traffic allowed to the pod.

**to selector:** selects egress/outgoing traffic that will be allowed.

**podSelector** select pods from/to .

**namesapaceSelector** namespace selection from/to .

**ipBlock** to select ip range cidr .

**ports**: specifies one or more ports that will allow traffic.

Traffic allowed if it matches both the allowed port and from/to rules.
