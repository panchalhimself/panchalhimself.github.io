# Restart policies in kubernetes
20 June 2023

Control what happens when the container is detected to be unhealthy.


**Always**

Default restart policy.
It will always restart the container on unhealthy/failure/stopped.


**OnFailure**

It will always restart the container on unhealthy or due to any error code.


**Never**

It will never restart the container.
Will stay in the error state for ever incase there is error that causes failure.



These restart policies are under the ```spec:```


```kubectl run pod-restart-always --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml```

creates a template and has already defined ```restartPolicy```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: pod-restart-always
  name: pod-restart-always
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: pod-restart-always
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
```

modify the **restartPolicy** according to the requirement.
