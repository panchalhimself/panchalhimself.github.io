## Falco and realtime k8s monitoring.


Falco is used for monitoring linux sys calls at runtime(whenever these syscalls are executed) based on the configurations. (real time monitoring of the cluster)

**Few examples:-**

1. Privilege Escalation (any container attemting to escalate privilege)
2. File Access (rw at particular locations)
3. Binary Executions (Suspicious binary execution)

Using cli ```falco``` command.

```falco -r <RULES_FILE>``` for custom rules file to be used with falco.
